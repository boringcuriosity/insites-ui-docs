Button is a component responsible for triggering actions or events, for instance, submitting Forms, opening Dialogs.
We bundled few variants of Buttons, so it suites context, where it's being used.

## Primary

This variant is suitable for triggering main events in your interface.

<DemoBox>
    <Button variant="primary">Submit now</Button>
</DemoBox>

```js
import { Button } from 'insites-ui'

<Button variant="primary">Submit now</Button>
```
