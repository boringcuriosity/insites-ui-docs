## Minimal, yet powerful

In terms of size (number of components and bundle size) the framework is somewhere
in between of Rebass and Chakra UI. We wanted it to be enough, not to pull
many third party libraries into our projects.

## Opinionated

The components follow unified Design Language which we developed, that
makes them look and feel consistent. Yet it's easy to override the
theme or extend the components with `styled-components` composition.

## Secure

The framework is written natively in TypeScript, so using it with a
TypeScript running project, it gives some extra confidence adding the properties.
Since the early version, we've been adding specs for the components, so
every time we publish new version, the components are being tested.
