## Before we start

Make sure you've got `Node` and optionally `Yarn`. Your `package.json` should contains following dependencies:
`react`, `react-dom` and `styled-components` 

## Installation

In your project's root, run the following command in your Terminal:

Pick one of the two below.

### Using Yarn

```sh
$ yarn add insites-ui
```

### Using NPM

```sh
$ npm i insites-ui
```

### ThemeProvider (for basic React apps and Create React App)

When your package manager finished installing `insites-ui`, you should add `ThemeProvider` to your project.
Place the ThemeProvider as high in JSX structure as you can. It can be for example a layout component.

```js
// /src/layouts/Default.js
import { ThemeProvider, theme } from 'insites-ui'

const DefaultLayout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      {children}
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}

export default DefaultLayout
```

If you are using Gatsby, please refer to [this guide](/framework-specific/gatsby).

### That's it 🎉

Now you can use the components from `insites-ui`.
